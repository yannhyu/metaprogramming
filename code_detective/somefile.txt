There's no reason to add more stress to an already delicate 
situation, but your forthright response could be tough for 
someone to handle, anyway. On one hand, everything might 
seem more difficult than it has to be today. On the other hand,
you're willing to follow an over-complicated plan because 
you have a very clear trajectory in mind, even if it's an 
unpopular one. Fortunately, you have the ability to elevate
the overall mood by simply choosing to acknowledge the good 
in everything and everyone
